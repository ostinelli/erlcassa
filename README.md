## ErlCassa

ErlCassa is an Erlang client to the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). This is an alpha library which should not be used in production.

## About CQL

[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) originally went with a Thrift RPC-based API as a way to provide a common denominator that more idiomatic clients could build upon independently. However, this worked poorly in practice: raw Thrift is too low-level to use productively, and keeping pace with new API methods to support (for example) indexes in 0.7 or distributed counters in 0.8 is too much for many maintainers to keep pace with.

CQL, the Cassandra Query Language, addresses this by pushing all implementation details to the server; all the client has to know for any operation is how to interpret “resultset” objects. So adding a feature like counters just requires teaching the CQL parser to understand “column + N” notation; no client-side changes are necessary.

CQL specification can be read here: (http://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/cql/CQL.textile)

## Install Dependencies

* You will need [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/download/) > 0.80.

### Note for OSX developers

The easiest way to install Thrift on your system is to:

* [install MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/install.php);
* Download and install Thrift dependencies using MacPorts by issuing the command:

```bash
$ sudo port install boost libevent pkgconfig
```

* [Download Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/download/), then compile and install it:

```bash
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-boost=/opt/local --with-libevent=/opt/local \
  --without-csharp --without-ruby --without-perl --without-haskell
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Quick Start

### Connecting to Cassandra

```erlang
{ok, C} = erlcassa_client:connect("localhost", 9160).
```

### Creating a Key Space

```erlang
{result, ok} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C,
    "CREATE KEYSPACE test1 WITH strategy_class = SimpleStrategy AND strategy_options:replication_factor = 1;"
).
```

### Using a Key Space

```erlang
erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "USE test1;").
```

### Creating a Column Family

```erlang
{result, ok} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "
	CREATE COLUMNFAMILY testdata (
	KEY int PRIMARY KEY,
	text_field text,
	ascii_field ascii,
	bigint_field bigint,
	blob_field blob,
	boolean_field boolean,
	counter_field counter,
	decimal_field decimal,
	double_field double,
	float_field float,
	timestamp_field timestamp,
	uuid_field uuid,
	varchar_field varchar,
	varint_field varint);
").
```

### Inserting an entry in a Column Family

```erlang
{result, ok} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "
	INSERT INTO testdata (
		KEY, text_field, ascii_field, bigint_field, blob_field, boolean_field,
		decimal_field, double_field, float_field, timestamp_field, uuid_field,
		varchar_field, varint_field
	) VALUES (
		123, 'text', 'ascii', 1234567890, 'aaaaaa', true,
		42, 1.3513535135, 1.2345, 1324244361517000, 'f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479',
		'encoded', 13
	);
").
```

### Getting rows from a Column Family, as proplist (dict is the other possible return value format)

```erlang
{result, {rows, Rows}} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "SELECT * FROM testdata", proplist).
```

### Returning an entire Column from an individual Row

```erlang
Column = erlcassa_client:get_column("KEY", Row).
```

### Dropping a Column Family

```erlang
{result, ok} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "DROP COLUMNFAMILY testdata;").
```

### Dropping a Keyspace

```erlang
{result, ok} = erlcassa_client:cql_execute(C, "DROP KEYSPACE test1;").
```
